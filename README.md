# sts_sat_form

The Stave & Thief Society is a forward-facing spirits education program, and it's unbranded approach has been gaining both members of all walks, and support from the distilling industry. Many distilleries are so excited about the program that they want to host it in THEIR distillery. As Stave & Thief Society standards are high, given that many activies involve hands-on distilling by the attendees, we needed a way to begin the screening process. A web form seems a great place to start. 

This project is a requirement for my Code Louisville cohort, and also an experimentation in form making.

This is a submission form for distillery representatives wanting to host the Stave & Thief Society Executive Bourbon Steaward program in their establishment, and the database that holds said submissions.

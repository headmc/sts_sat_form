The Stave & Thief Society is a forward-facing spirits education program, based in Louisville, Kentucky. Its unbranded approach has been gaining in popularity with both enthusiasts and professionals in the industtry since the program inception in 2015. Many distilleries are so excited about the program that they want to host it in THEIR distillery - typically no where near Louisville. As Stave & Thief Society standards are high, given that many activies involve hands-on distilling by the attendees, we needed a way to begin the screening process. A web form seems a great place to start, especially since data collection by three separate individuals have yielded radically different results (of course).

This project is a requirement for my Code Louisville cohort, and also an experiment in form making.

It is a submission form for distillery representatives wanting to host the Stave & Thief Society Executive Bourbon Steaward program in their establishment, and the database that holds said submissions.
